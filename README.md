# Disclaimer:
STOCK MARKET IS VERY RISKY UNTIL YOU DO IT PROPERLY. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE TRADES JUST BECAUSE THIS TOOL GIVES YOU THE NAME. APPLY YOUR OWN LEARNINGS, CREATE YOUR OWN STRATEGY, ASSESS RISK & TRADE THE PLAN.

```diff
-Trade at you own risk as No one will be held responsible for the losses incurred exept the trader.
```

I personally have lost some money in intraday without plan and own judgement. This tool can help you with manual effort of selecting stocks from listed 1600 stocks but you have to use your knowledge after that.

## Currently Working On (Long term project): 
```diff
+ Live News based AI model to predict the sentiment of news related to stock. Predict probability whether a stock will go up or down based on the sentiment of the news.
+ RL (Reinforcement Learning) for trades suggestion given different conditions.
```

## Usage Steps: 

1. **Download and Install** [Python 3.7 and above](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. `Fork` or `Clone` the project. For Non- tech, Windows users, find `Fork` button on upper right hand corner, fork it. Look for the **Green** `Code` button and download the zip file, extract it.
3. Find and open the directory by the name **NSE-Stock-Scanner** inside above zip file. Open Terminal ( For Linux) or Command Prompt or Git Shell in Windows inside the directory.
4. Run the following Commands:
```
cd ./NSE-Stock-Scanner

jupyter lab
```
4. Open `Tutorial.ipynb` in your browser for Documentation and usage
5. Go to first cell (just below *Imports, Defaults and Initializations* where some code is written) and press `Shit + Enter`.
6. To run any cell, just do the same. [Read the commands here if you need help in running it](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jupyter/jupyter_notebook_editing.htm)

7. I am updating this code on a regular basis so if you want to keep updated, just run `git pull` inside the same folder

For usage, see the docstring of code or the example ipython Notebook `Test.ipynb`

```diff
- NOTE: There is some bug in fetching live data and data refresh so if you are not ubale to get some data, or get an error; restart kernal and run cells again
```

[Financial Literacy in India](https://www.financialexpress.com/market/only-27-indians-are-financially-literate-sebis-garg/2134842/)


## Initial Work:
**Basic Usage**: 
1. Download of more than 1800 NSE stocks for 1 days. Run it after 11:30 PM IST to get day's stocks results as the market is closed at that time.
2. Plot Candle Sticks of stocks with moving average support.
3. Pick and Scan all the stocks based on your budget, loss threshold, profit apetite, `K` Moving Average etc


**Note**: I started out as an enthusiast for this concept of `44 SMA` style but backtested it using my own written code and found out that it gives you around `40-45%` Hit-Loss %. So? Learn More.

[See this video to know what is mimicks](https://youtu.be/dFibByGQWak?t=3747). All it does is to save your time rather when you have to go through 1800 stocks to pick. You can click and scan the stocks of your moving average. It does not support `Short Selling` but can be implementd by changing the code easily.


**This is not a trading Bot or software** but a mere tool to see the live charts, candlesticks for the stocks of your choice. **All it does is tell you all the available stocks** which are closest to and are on the upper side of 44 Moving Average.
